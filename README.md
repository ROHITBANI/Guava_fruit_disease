Guava Disease Prediction
This project focuses on predicting diseases in guava fruits using computer vision and machine learning.
By leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a carefully curated dataset of guava fruit images,
the model identifies three key categories: Anthracnose, Fruit Flies, and Healthy Fruits.
Early and accurate disease detection can help farmers mitigate losses and ensure higher crop quality.

Project Overview
Objective: To develop a machine learning-based model for automatic detection of guava diseases from fruit images.

Dataset: The dataset includes 3,784 preprocessed and augmented images of guava fruits, divided into three classes:

Anthracnose (disease caused by fungi)
Fruit Flies (damage caused by insects)
Healthy Fruits
Model: A CNN architecture is trained to classify images into the three categories with high accuracy.
